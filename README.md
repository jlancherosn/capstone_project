## Introduction
The purpose of this project is to develop a statistical model to predict economic losses associated with financial risks, specifically credit, market, or operational risks. Financial institutions constantly face these risks, and their ability to measure and manage potential losses is crucial for ensuring financial stability.

**Problem Statement**
The main problem addressed in this project is the accurate prediction of economic losses due to financial risk events. Identifying the factors that influence these losses and developing a predictive model will enable institutions to make informed decisions to mitigate these risks.

**Significance**
Managing financial risks is essential for institutions operating in highly volatile markets. By developing an efficient predictive model, potential losses can be estimated, allowing for proactive mitigation strategies. This not only improves financial stability but also optimizes capital allocation, ensuring institutions comply with regulatory requirements and maintain solvency.

## Dataset Overview
The dataset used in this project is a CSV file containing two key columns: date and loss. These columns provide the minimum necessary information to operate the economic model for predicting financial losses.

Source: The dataset is provided alongside the project code as an anonymized sample dataset. It functions as an illustrative example for building the economic model.
Format: CSV file with two columns:
date: The date of the recorded financial event.
loss: The amount of financial loss associated with the event on the given date.

**Variable Significance**
* date: This variable represents the time dimension of the financial loss data. It is essential for identifying trends or patterns in the occurrence of financial loss events over time, which could be important for making temporal predictions.

* loss: The loss variable quantifies the economic impact of each financial event. It is the primary dependent variable that the model aims to predict. Accurately modeling this variable allows financial institutions to anticipate potential losses and implement mitigation strategies accordingly.

**Importance to the Problem**
Given that financial institutions need to predict and manage risk, the combination of date and loss data provides a foundation for constructing a time-series model or other relevant statistical models. By analyzing historical loss data, the model can forecast future losses and help institutions prepare for potential financial downturns.

## Approach and Methodology
To address the problem of predicting economic losses due to financial risks, we employ an Aggregate Loss Distribution Approach. This approach involves combining the frequency and severity distributions of financial losses to model the total loss distribution effectively. The methodology includes the following steps:

**1. Frequency Distribution:**

This represents the number of financial loss events occurring over a specific period. It can be modeled using various statistical distributions, such as Poisson or Negative Binomial distributions, depending on the nature of the data.

**2. Severity Distribution:**

This represents the magnitude of losses associated with each event. Common distributions used for modeling severity include the Exponential, Gamma, or Pareto distributions, depending on the characteristics of the loss data.

**3. Convolution of Distributions:**

The total loss distribution is obtained by convolving the frequency and severity distributions. Mathematically, if $F(x)$ represents the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the frequency distribution and $S(x)$ represents the CDF of the severity distribution, the convolution can be expressed as:

$$L(x) = \int_{0}^{x} f(x - y) \dot s(y) dy$$

where $f(x)$ is the probability density function (PDF) of the frequency distribution and s(x) is the PDF of the severity distribution. This integral calculates the total loss distribution by combining the frequency and severity data.

**4. Monte Carlo Simulations:**

Monte Carlo simulations are used to estimate the aggregate loss distribution by generating random samples based on the frequency and severity distributions. The process involves the following steps:

1. Simulate Number of Events: For each simulation run, draw a random number from the frequency distribution to determine the number of loss events.
2. Simulate Loss Amounts: For each event, draw random loss amounts from the severity distribution.
3. Aggregate Loss Calculation: Sum the loss amounts for each simulation run to compute the total loss.
   
Mathematically, if $N$ represents the number of simulations, $E_{i}$ is the number of events in the $i-th$ simulation, and $\lbrace L_{i, j} \rbrace _{j=1}{E_i}$ are the simulated loss amounts for the $i-th$ simulation, the total loss for the $i-th$ simulation can be expressed as:

$$T_i = \sum_{j=1}^{E_i} L_{i, j}.$$

$$\hat{L}(x) = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^{N} \mathbb{I}(L_{i} \leq x)$$

where $\mathbb{I}(L_{i} \leq x)$ is an indicator function that equals $1$ if $L_i$ is less than or equal to $x$ and $0$ otherwise. This approximation helps in estimating the probability of various levels of aggregate losses.
